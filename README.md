# eye-tracker-game-project #

Playing games with eye movements is a very interesting topic and eye trackers are one of the greatest products of advanced technology. In EyeGames, there are two objectives; one of them is obviously fun and the other one is a kind of medical issue. There is a sickness called Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) and it affects people' vision in a serious way. This disease can be treated only by practicing eye muscles in early ages and EyeGames, because it is fun to use, and is a great product for Amblyopia kids, too.

*This was my second year project in university.
